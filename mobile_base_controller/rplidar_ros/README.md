# Note about this repository
This repository was sent by the RP LIDAR team directly as a temporary fix since the public version at https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros doesn't work for the RP LIDAR S2 currently.

Once they fix it, this repository will be deleted and we'll use https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros instead.
